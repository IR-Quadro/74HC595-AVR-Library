## Contents

- `single_mode/` â€“ Basic control of a single 74HC595 IC (e.g., for 8 relays or LEDs).
- More examples and use-cases will be added in future updates.

## Requirements

- PlatformIO with AVR support
- A basic understanding of how shift registers work

Feel free to explore, use, and modify the code for your own AVR projects.
